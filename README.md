# space_gen
Simple, hackable Open API generator for Dart

This is not designed to be a full implementation of OpenAPI.  Currently
just enough to generate beautiful Dart bindings for spacetraders.io.

Patches welcome to expand it to support a wider set of OpenAPI.

## Usage

dart run space_gen

## Why not just contribute to OpenAPI?

As of August 2023, there are two separate (soon to be combined?) OpenAPI
generators for Dart.  One for package:http and one for package:dio.  I only
ever used the http one and it had lots of bugs.  I looked at fixing them
in OpenAPI, but failed to figure out how to hack on the OpenAPI generator
(Java) or successfully interact with the community (several separate slacks).
